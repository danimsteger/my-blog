# my-blog

## Description

This project involved creating a blog submission form and populate blog entries to a new page from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This practical project helped to reinforce HTML and CSS skills while also incorporating JavaScript logic and Web APIs. You can view this webpage by clicking [here](https://danimsteger.github.io/my-blog/).

If an input field is left blank, an alert will pop up and will remind you to complete all forms before you can submit.

When the 'Submit' button is clicked, the inputs are stored locally and you will be taken to the blog entries page where all blog entries are shown.

When you click the 'Back' button on this page, you are redirected back to the submission form page to input another entry.

The moon and sun icons in the top right corner of each page toggle the page back and forth between and light and dark mode.

To the most recent blog entry object and the array of all blog entries in local storage, right-click on the page and choose 'Inspect' from the drop-down menu. A new window will open on the right side of the screen and from their you can view the local storage. If on a Firefox browser, the pane will open at the bottom of your screen, instead of on the right side.
